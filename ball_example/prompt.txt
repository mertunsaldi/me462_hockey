-before writing the code, tell me what you understood, and discuss whether you will be able to write it in a single code, or should we break it to part by part
-i want a modular design, if there is a mistake or improvement to do, i want to be able to change only that part without touching anything else.
-use flask to create the gui, opencv for image processing
-create game class
    -holds list of all balls
-create a ball class
    -center point of ball
    -radius in pixels
    -color
    -velocity(vector): nominal=0

- I will look at the arena from the top, live feed from webcam, inside this arena a ball will be moving or standing still
- Functions
    - detect all balls: input: raw image, return: ball object without velocity
    - detect velocity: for all ball objects look at some consequent raw images edit their velocity vector (x, y, speed)
    - new image: input: raw image, (output of detect ball func.), return: new image with all balls center point of ball, edge of the ball (calculated from ball radius), velocity arrow starting from ball center with writing speed on it

- A game loop to take images from camera and processes it with the functions

- In the gui:
    -shrink the processed image to responsively fit the browser window, preserving the aspect ratio.
    - write the critical values inside a box, so i can understand the code works as it should

- Care for:
    - there can be multiple balls
    - to detect velocity you need multiple images, come up with a technique to efficiently and correctly do it.
